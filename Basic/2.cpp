// 2. What is oops & list of oops concept ?

Ans. OOPS means  Object Oriented Programming System.

Oops concepts here :

1. Encapsulation: Hiding internal details of an object from the outside world and only exposing necessary information through public methods.

2. Abstraction: Showing only essential features of an object while hiding its internal implementation.

3. Inheritance: Creating a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and behavior.

4. Polymorphism: Ability of an object to take on multiple forms, depending on the context in which it's used.

5. Composition: Creating objects from other objects, allowing for complex structures.

6. Classes: Blueprints or templates for creating objects.

7. Objects: Instances of classes, representing real-world entities.

8. Constructors: Special methods used to initialize objects when they're created.

9. Methods: Functions that belong to an object or class, defining its behavior.

10. Attributes: Data members of an object or class, representing its properties.

11. Interfaces: Abstract classes that define a contract or set of methods that must be implemented.

12. Overloading: Having multiple methods or operators with the same name but different parameters.

13. Overriding: Providing a specific implementation for a method already defined in a superclass.

14. Static members: Properties and methods that belong to a class, not instances.
