// 3.What is the difference between OOP and POP?

Ans :
	OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and POP (Procedural-Oriented Programming) are 
	two fundamental programming paradigms that differ in their approach to software 
	design and development.
	
	Procedural-Oriented Programming (POP):

1. Focuses on procedures or functions that perform specific tasks.
2. Emphasizes step-by-step execution of procedures.
3. Uses functions, loops, and conditional statements to control program flow.
4. Data is shared among procedures through parameters and global variables.
5. Programs are typically structured around procedures or functions.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

1. Focuses on objects that represent real-world entities or abstract concepts.
2. Emphasizes data encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
3. Uses objects, classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to organize code.
4. Data is hidden within objects, and access is controlled through methods.
5. Programs are typically structured around objects and their interactions.

Key differences:

- Modularity: OOP promotes modular code through objects, while POP uses procedures.
- Data handling: OOP encapsulates data within objects, while POP shares data globally.
- Code reuse: OOP enables code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism, while POP relies on function reuse.
- Program structure: OOP organizes code around objects, while POP structures code around procedures.

In summary, POP focuses on procedures and step-by-step execution, while OOP emphasizes objects, 
data encapsulation, and modular code organization. OOP is generally considered more suitable for complex, 
large-scale software development, while POP is often used for smaller, more straightforward programs.
